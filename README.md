Final Year Project - Interior Designer App

Projec title: 
Horizon Interior Design

Project vision:
Horizon Interior Design is an android mobile application for users looking to redecorate their rooms and those interested in interior design, who want to visualise and experiment with different styles and colours. The application uses augmented reality to change the colours of walls, drag and drop a pre-made set of furniture into a room and save their creations.

Project supervisor: Thomas Wennekers
